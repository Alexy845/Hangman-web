                The goal of the game is simple: guess all the letters that must compose a word and this with a limited number of attempts, but be careful because the hanged man is none other than Santa Claus himself!<br><br>
1. You start the game with some given letter(s) to help you find the word, except in hard mode where you start with nothing and are on your own.<br><br>
2. Each time the player guesses a letter, it is displayed. Otherwise, the drawing of a hanged man begins to appear and you lose a life and in the hard mode you are entitled to three vowels after you also lose a life.<br><br>
3. When the player loses a life, You are given the letters you have already tested, again in the hard mode we guide you more on this too and you no longer have your letters used, so remember them well ðŸ˜‰ .<br><br>
4. You have the possibility to guess a whole word whenever you want, but be careful because if you are wrong you lose two lives and the drawing of the hanged man is built faster.<br><br>
5. The game ends when you have found the word... or when you have more life and you have your pretty hangman Santa Claus and say goodbye to your Christmas presents ðŸ™‚ .<br><br>
